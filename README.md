With expectation of being a master in the field I indulged. I entered the school of STDU, wanting to be a programmer in the future.

At that time, I' ve nerver been so facinated in the matter, code. I think it is very cool.

I started my new life in university.

2020.07.23

I have learned C/C++/Java. And started to learn web develop. At that time, I want a place to save my code. so I joined the platform - github.

Maybe the school I entered is not good enough, when I was a freshman, I had never heard about 'Github', even now, few of my classmate use github or gitee as their repository to save code. So even now, I was usually misunderstood - why you push all your code in a website, are you sure you will review them in the future ? I don't know.

But. It was exactly at that time, I gradually started to think what I really need to develop in my University to make me to be a master. From then on, I no longer focus all my attention on credits and grades, but the ability of study and creativity.

Yes. At that time, the most needed ability I think is learning ability and creativity.

Learn, Create, It's so cool !

I have submitted 10000+ lines of code in GitHub and am working on my own blog (although the design is very bad). 

I am trying to learn relevant knowledge and make myself a better person. 

Come on
